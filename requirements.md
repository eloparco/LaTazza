# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

```plantuml

## Interfaces

| Actor                         | Logical Interface	| Physical Interface    |
|-------------------------------|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|
| Manager      			        | GUI			    | Screen, keyboard		|
| Coffee Capsule Vendor         | Web service, APIs	| Internet connection	|

The banking/credit card system is not listed in the actors because, even if the application makes the orders automatically once the manager choose to buy new boxes of capsules from the GUI, the payment to the vendor is handled separately (by the manager, not the application).
