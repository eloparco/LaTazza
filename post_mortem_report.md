# Requirements

Our requirement document was different from the official one, but that is normal, considering that the informal description was general, leaving space to multiple interpretations.
In addition to what is written in the official requirement, we decided to use LaTazza to automate the order of capsules (via emails) and to turn a little profit for the manager in charge of using the application (adding a profit percentage to the capsule purchase price).

# Design

We focused on getting a simple design with a simple persistency method (serialization). Our efforts were rewarded, leading to a system with small classes, easy to fix and maintain in the subsequent deadlines.
Our choice paid off, considering that other teams were struggling using external libraries and more complex persistency solutions.
